- [ ] For the above consider using straight git commands and removing gogit

- [ ] Support pre-release tags for latest and promotions correctly

- [ ] Refactor end to end tests to reuse setup and assertions 
- [ ] Refactor unit tests for gogit to use nested test tables so multiple 
combinations of tests can be run and reused
